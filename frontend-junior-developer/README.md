## Assignment

The project is a simple React app bundled with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
We ask you to do one commit per section that you will find below.
None of those sections should be blocking you, so if you can't achieve one of those, just skip to the next one and keep us informed :)

### Data fetching

The goal here is to fetch some data from an external API. We want to see how you'll do it.

- [x] In the `src/App.tsx` display a list of items fetched from your chosen API
